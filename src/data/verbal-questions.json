    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "<p>The correct answer is <strong>C) involving heated disagreement</strong>. The word <strong>'contentious'</strong> means characterized by <strong>heated argument, controversy, or dispute</strong>. The passage provides abundant context clues: residents expressed <strong>frustration</strong>, others were <strong>visibly agitated</strong>, people were <strong>interrupting speakers</strong>, and attendees were <strong>demanding immediate answers</strong>. All of these details describe a meeting filled with heated disagreement.</p><h4>Reading Context Clues</h4><p>Even if you are unfamiliar with 'contentious,' the passage gives you everything you need. The sentence structure is: 'The meeting grew contentious <em>when</em> residents learned about the demolition plan.' The word 'grew' tells you the meeting <em>became</em> something — and the details that follow (frustration, agitation, interruptions) tell you exactly what it became: a scene of heated conflict.</p><div class=\"key-insight\"><strong>SAT Tip:</strong> For Words in Context, always read the <strong>full sentence and the sentences around it</strong> for clues. When a passage describes the <em>effects</em> of a word (what happened after the meeting 'grew contentious'), those effects define the word for you. Match the tone and intensity of the surrounding details to the answer choice.</div><div class=\"wrong-answer-note\"><strong>Why not A) boring and uneventful?</strong> This is the <strong>opposite</strong> of what the passage describes. A meeting with frustrated residents, visible agitation, interruptions, and demands is anything but boring. The SAT sometimes includes an antonym as a trap choice.</div><div class=\"wrong-answer-note\"><strong>Why not B) well organized?</strong> The passage describes a chaotic scene with <strong>interruptions and demands</strong>, which directly contradicts the idea of a well-organized meeting. Good organization implies order; the passage depicts disorder.</div><div class=\"wrong-answer-note\"><strong>Why not D) lasting a long time?</strong> 'Contentious' describes the <strong>nature</strong> of the meeting (heated disagreement), not its <strong>duration</strong>. The passage says nothing about how long the meeting lasted. Duration and tone are completely different qualities.</div>"

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "<p>The correct answer is <strong>B) is</strong>. The subject of this sentence is <strong>'every one,'</strong> which is grammatically <strong>singular</strong> despite referring to multiple students. The long prepositional phrase <strong>'of the students participating in the science fair'</strong> is a modifier — it does not change the number of the subject. Since the sentence describes an <strong>ongoing requirement</strong> (not a past event), the present tense singular <strong>'is'</strong> is correct.</p><h4>Why 'Every One' Is Singular</h4><p>The phrase 'every one' emphasizes <strong>each individual separately</strong>, not the group as a whole. Think of it as 'every single one.' This individual emphasis makes it grammatically singular, just like 'each,' 'everyone,' and 'every.' On the SAT, any subject beginning with 'every' takes a singular verb.</p><div class=\"key-insight\"><strong>SAT Tip:</strong> Subjects beginning with <strong>'every'</strong> (every one, everyone, every student, every single) are <strong>always singular</strong> on the SAT. Long prepositional phrases between the subject and verb are designed to make you lose track of the true subject. Mentally remove the phrase to find the core: 'Every one ... ___ required to submit.' The singular 'is' becomes obvious.</div><div class=\"wrong-answer-note\"><strong>Why not A) are?</strong> 'Are' is a <strong>plural verb</strong> that does not agree with the singular subject 'every one.' Students are tempted by this because 'students' (plural) appears nearby, but the true subject is 'every one,' not 'students.'</div><div class=\"wrong-answer-note\"><strong>Why not C) were?</strong> 'Were' shifts to the <strong>past tense</strong>, which is unjustified by the context. The sentence describes a current, ongoing requirement ('at least two weeks before the event'), not a past event. There is no reason to use past tense here.</div><div class=\"wrong-answer-note\"><strong>Why not D) have been?</strong> 'Have' is a <strong>plural auxiliary</strong> (the singular form would be 'has'). This creates the same agreement error as Choice A. Additionally, the present perfect tense 'have been' suggests an action with ongoing relevance from the past, which is unnecessary for stating a current rule.</div>"

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "<p>The correct answer is <strong>B</strong>. Choice B directly addresses the student's goal — <strong>establishing why renewable energy matters</strong> — by connecting it to two urgent global issues: <strong>climate change</strong> and <strong>dependence on finite fossil fuels</strong>. The phrase 'making them essential' explicitly establishes importance, and the reference to 'the global effort to combat climate change' gives the reader a compelling reason to care about the topic.</p><h4>Matching the Rhetorical Goal</h4><p>The student's goal is specifically to introduce the topic by explaining <strong>why it matters</strong>. This requires an answer that provides a <em>reason</em> or <em>justification</em> for the importance of renewable energy. Listing types, citing history, or noting investment trends may be relevant to the topic but do not answer the 'why does this matter?' question.</p><div class=\"key-insight\"><strong>SAT Tip:</strong> In Rhetorical Synthesis questions, pay close attention to the <strong>specific verb</strong> in the student's goal. 'Establish why renewable energy matters' requires a <em>reason</em> (why), not a list (what), a date (when), or a trend (who). The correct answer must contain language that directly explains significance or importance — look for words like 'essential,' 'critical,' 'because,' or 'important.'</div><div class=\"wrong-answer-note\"><strong>Why not A)?</strong> Choice A <strong>lists types</strong> of renewable energy (solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal) but never explains <em>why</em> they matter. It answers the question 'what kinds exist?' rather than 'why do they matter?' This is informative but does not establish importance.</div><div class=\"wrong-answer-note\"><strong>Why not C)?</strong> Choice C provides a <strong>historical fact</strong> about the first solar cell (1954, Bell Laboratories). While interesting, this is a piece of trivia that does not establish why renewable energy is important today. Historical origin does not equal current significance.</div><div class=\"wrong-answer-note\"><strong>Why not D)?</strong> Choice D notes that <strong>many countries have invested</strong> in renewable energy, but this describes a trend without explaining the underlying reason. It tells us that countries are investing, but not <em>why</em> — which is exactly what the student needs to establish.</div>"
